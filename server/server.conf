### Delay after hand tracking starts to allow for stopping the hand wave before gestures are sent
### (milliseconds)
startdelay=800

### Minimum travel distance per frame to be considered in the gesture (millimeters)
traveldistance=10

### Amount of frames travelled that triggers the directional gesture
travelframes=5

### Cooldown time for the gesture, ie. milliseconds to wait before another gesture is sent
cooldown=500

### List of exit directions that signal exit of interaction and all hand tracking is stopped
