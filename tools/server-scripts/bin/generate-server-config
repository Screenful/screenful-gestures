### Screenful UI Gesture Server configuration file

### Adjust these values to set the server settings and gesture recognition sensitivity.
###
### traveldistance = how small a motion is considered (mm)
### travelframes = how many times that motion must occur to the same general direction (number)
### cooldown = how long to wait after each gesture before another can be sent

### WebSocket server port
port=${PORT}

### Server bind address
address=${ADDRESS}

### Delay after hand tracking starts to allow for stopping the hand wave before gestures are sent
### (milliseconds)
startdelay=${STARTDELAY}

### Minimum travel distance per frame to be considered in the gesture (millimeters)
traveldistance=${TRAVELDISTANCE}

### Amount of frames travelled that triggers the directional gesture
travelframes=${TRAVELFRAMES}

### Cooldown time for the gesture, ie. milliseconds to wait before another gesture is sent
cooldown=${COOLDOWN}

### List of exit directions that signal exit of interaction and all hand tracking is stopped
exitdirections=${EXITDIRECTIONS}

### A comma separated list of directions that are sent as gestures through the WebSocket
enableddirections=${ENABLEDDIRECTIONS}

### A comma separated list of gestures that start hand tracking ("click" and/or "wave" or "none")
startgestures=${STARTGESTURES}
