/**
 * Experimental "bytebeat" controller, unfinished and tacky for now. When the
 * program starts, two windows will spawn, one for hand tracker depth image and
 * one for beat parameters a, b and c.
 *
 * The program simply squeals numbers out of the speakers, and uses a time
 * counter that increases with each tick. For 8 kHz sound, the data would be
 * played 8000 times a second. The actual noise comes from simple (or complex)
 * functions that use the time counter and the parameters as input and return a
 * number. typically using arithmetic and bitwise operations to generate
 * repeating and evolving patterns that may be "music", or perhaps something
 * else. Modifying the parameters in real-time lets one experiment with the
 * sounds.
 *
 * To start controlling the beat, make a "click" gesture towards the sensor,
 * preferably at around 1.5 meters or more and with the sensor in front of you.
 * The hand tracker window will show a blue rectangle tracking the hand when you
 * have control.
 *
 * The program uses a DirectionDetector to look for movement in the cardinal
 * directions (left, right, up, down, in, out) within the space perceived by the
 * sensor. For accurate control, move the hand in straight lines to one of the
 * directions. The sensitivity can be controlled with the parameters in the
 * controller's constructor.
 *
 * Controls:
 *
 * Right-Left - a++, a--
 *
 * Up-Down - b++, b--
 *
 * In-Out - c++, c--
 *
 * Pressing Enter in the console rotates between a few functions, not all of
 * them very good.
 *
 * For now it uses only the hand tracker, but could potentially utilize the
 * X-Y-Z directional movement of all the 15 joint positions times the number of
 * people + the movement of all tracked hands. If a directional movement in one
 * of the six directions is considered a command, a single skeleton could be
 * used to trigger 90 of them. The effects of such a number of inputs may need
 * some thought in the function, but would probably be interesting, as would
 * making formulas that make use of complex motions a human can make.
 *
 * Limbniz is not based on but is inspired by IBNIZ by Ville-Matias HeikkilÃ¤:
